With a modern, RESTful API and a comprehensive partner ecosystem, HPE OneView delivers a software-defined, programmatic approach to managing infrastructure for efficient workflow automation. The [HPE OneView Ruby SDK v5.10.0](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-sdk-ruby/releases/tag/v5.10.0) is now available and supports HPE OneView 5.0 (REST API version 1200). The HPE OneView RUBY SDK extends the HPE OneView API language support for the Ruby language. This Ruby SDK provides a Ruby Library to easily interact with the HPE OneView API, enabling developers to easily build integrations and scalable solutions with HPE OneView.

This SDK allows Ruby developers to programmatically control HPE OneView managed resources using an infrastructure-as-code approach for physical compute, storage, and fabric resources. Using infrastructure-as-code enables complete datacenter automation, consistent reproducibility, versioning, and roll back.

Ruby is a popular software language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. A number of widely used tools and frameworks, such as Puppet, are written in Ruby. In addition, it is a popular choice for building web and data analysis applications.
