Some HPE DEV team members and I just returned from beautiful Portland, Oregon with another successful [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or) in the books. As a Gold sponsor for OSCON for the past two years, the HPE Developer Community always looks forward to attending this premier open source event. I’m always astounded by the technical proficiency of this crowd and their knowledge depth. We also enjoy meeting with developers, like you, who are using Grommet and our open source solutions and discussing your experience with these products face-to-face. This is truly a developer’s conference.![5bf2e1a0cd93d0796238ae01-blog-content-1564600566237](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2019/5/picture2-1564600566235.png)
As a last minute addition to our booth, Blaine, Jeff, Pramod, and I decided to host a [Hack Shack Attack!](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe-hack-shack-attack) gaming competition, offering awesome collector Lego sets as prizes. For those of you who don’t know, __Hack Shack Attack!__ is our open source, 8-bit arcade game that gives players a chance to tame the IT monster. Since this game was a late addition to our booth, I had to run out to Gamestop the evening before the event to pick up an Xbox controller and write the controller bindings overnight. The game was originally built to support Nvidia Shield controllers, which would be almost impossible to find in a retail store. That being said, I am glad we brought the game and updated the controller bindings, because it proved wildly popular with attendees. We saw a total 1,040 game plays! That IT monster didn’t know what hit him. 

As usual, Grommet and our Grommet Gremlin, Stack (the purple guy you see in the footer of the [HPE DEV home page](https://developer.hpe.com/)), drew a crowd. Pramod Sareddy drummed up a lot of attention for Grommet during his Open Service Broker (OSB) + Grommet for the Enterprise presentation. You can learn more about what Pramod presented in our [pre-OSCON blog.](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/solving-enterprise-devops-and-front-end-challenges-with-open-source-at-o)

Talking with developers and their experiences with our products often leads to inspired innovation, both on our part and theirs. It’s discussions like these that help us find better ways to support the HPE Developer Community. We look forward to seeing everyone again at OSCON 2020!
