In [Part 1](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/dark-mode-theming-in-grommet-how-to-set-up-and-apply-a-theme) of this 3-part series on Grommet’s support for light and dark modes, I covered setting up a simple Grommet app and applying a theme to that app. Here in Part 2, I’ll guide you through the steps required to implement dark/light theme modes. At the conclusion of this post, the app will have some basic UI components and a control to toggle the interface between light and dark modes.

- [Part 1 - How to set up and apply a Theme](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/dark-mode-theming-in-grommet-how-to-set-up-and-apply-a-theme)
- Part 2 - Adding dark and light theme modes
- Part 3 - Theme color customizations

In this post, I’ll cover content regarding adding a theme toggle button, including:
  
 * Introducing the `themeMode` prop, which allows specifying which version of the theme the app renders.
   
* Adding a button to the interface to serve as a control to toggle the value that gets passed to `themeMode`.

## Adding a Theme Toggle Button
For this exercise, you’ll continue modifying your app from the example you created in Part 1 of this series.  If you are catching up and joining midstream, you can reference this [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/grommet-theme-toggle-1adding-theme-rg91i?file=/src/App.js).
   
First, I’m going to show you how to add a button that, when clicked, will toggle the theme between light and dark modes.
    
In App.js:
    
Add the [_**themeMode**_](https://v2.grommet.io/grommet#themeMode) prop to the `<Grommet>` component and set its value to `"dark"`. The value referenced by `themeMode` specifies whether Grommet should use the dark or light versions of the theme.

```javascript
<Grommet full theme={theme} themeMode="dark" >

```This should result in:

Next, add a button to serve as the toggle control.
      
Import `Button` as a component from Grommet
     

```javascript
import { Grommet, Anchor, Box, Button, List, Heading, Paragraph, Text } from "grommet";
```Below the `<List>`, add a theme toggle button with some formatting props and an `onClick` handler.
```javascript

  <Button
    label="Toggle Theme"
    primary
    alignSelf="center"
    margin="large"
    onClick={() => {}} 
  />
```## Enable Toggling of ThemeMode’s State
Next, make the theme mode dynamic by adding a variable `darkMode` to hold the current theme mode, storing it in the component’s state, and adjusting the state each time the theme toggle button is clicked.
   
Create variable `darkMode` and its state using React’s [`useState` Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).


```javascript
const App = () => {
 const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = React.useState(false);
  return (
   <Grommet full theme={grommet} themeMode="dark">

```Modify the button’s `onClick` handler to toggle `darkMode` between `true` and `false`.


```html
<Button
    label="Toggle Theme"
    primary
    alignSelf="center"
    margin="large"
    onClick={() => setDarkMode(!darkMode)}
  />

```Next, replace `themeMode`’s value to be “dark” when `darkMode` is true, and “light” when `darkMode` is false.
```javascript 
<Grommet full theme={theme} themeMode={darkMode ? "dark" : "light"} >

```

The theme mode toggling should be good to go. Give the toggle button a few clicks!

## Incorporating More Visual Interest
Finally, to better demonstrate a changing theme, let’s add some more interesting visuals to the application.

Remove the following from App.js
 
```javascript
   <Paragraph>We will be modifying this project to:</Paragraph>
    <List data={projectTasks}>
      {(task, index) => (
        <Text key={index}>
          {index + 1}) {task}
        </Text>
      )}
    </List>
```Then, import the DemoSection from `DemoSection.js` and add it below the toggle button. DemoSection contains a sampling of Grommet components to better demonstrate the effect themeMode has across components.


```javascript
  import { DemoSection } from "./DemoSection";	
```
Then add DemoSection directly beneath this button.


```javascript
      <Button
         label="Toggle Theme"
         primary
         alignSelf="center"
         margin="large"
         onClick={() => setDarkMode(!darkMode)}
       />
       <DemoSection />
```At this point, your code and resulting app should resemble what is shown in this [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/grommet-theme-toggle-2addtogglebutton-txbux?file=/src/App.js).

As quick review, here’s what we’ve done to modify the app:
      
 * Added `themeMode` as a prop on the `<Grommet>` component. The value provided to `themeMode` specifies which mode of the theme to use.
   
* Created a state variable called `darkMode` to store whether the theme should currently be in dark mode.
   
* Enabled the value of the `themeMode` prop to update when the value of `darkMode` changes.
   
* Added a `<Button>` to serve as control to toggle the theme mode by toggling the state of `darkMode`.
   
* Lastly, made the app interface a bit more interesting to demonstrate how various components are affected by toggling the `themeMode`.That’s it for Part 2! In Part 3, I’ll demonstrate how to customize a theme with custom dark and light mode colors. Don’t forget to check back at the HPE DEV blog to catch Part 3 of this series.
