ChefConf is the annual three day gathering of the DevOps and Continuous Automation community. This year, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) will be on-hand at [ChefConf 2018](http://chefconf.chef.io/) in Chicago to discuss the latest and greatest in DevOps workflow, infrastructure, compliance, and application automation. 

The event, which takes place May 22-25, offers attendees a chance to attend sessions and demos delivered by the leading experts in DevOps, cloud-native development, and IT strategies from around the world.  If you are going to the event next week, don’t miss these sessions from HPE experts:

## **Complacency is a killer; Innovation is not enough; what’s next?**

*Tuesday, May 22nd at 10:30 AM*

“That’s the way we’ve always done it” are the most dangerous words in the English language to businesses. In this session, HPE experts will examine the impact of complacency and how innovation alone is no longer enough in the modern digital age.  Today’s technology savvy consumers and startups are disrupting all industries. Learn how traditional enterprise IT can transform to support ever-changing business demands. 

## **Deploy your applications anywhere safely with Habitat and HPE OneSphere**   

*Tuesday, May 22nd, 6:00 PM*

[HPE OneSphere](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/cloud/hybrid-it-management.html) provides a hybrid cloud management platform that spans public clouds, like AWS, as well as private clouds. In this demo, HPE will show how the HPE OneSphere APIs deploy habitat applications to both public cloud as well as the [HPE Synergy](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/synergy.html) platform running in the data center (without any change to the underlying application).
