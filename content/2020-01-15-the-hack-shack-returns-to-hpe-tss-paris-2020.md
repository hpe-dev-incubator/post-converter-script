HPE Technology and Solutions Summit (TSS) is the largest and most comprehensive technical knowledge transfer event held by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).  Delivered annually since its inception in 2006, HPE TSS has established a reputation as a renowned training initiative. With separate events held in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the US, presales consultants and solutions architects from HPE and partner communities  from all over the world benefit from direct access to HPE technology experts, engineers, and chief technologists. In Europe this year, the city of lights (Paris, France) will once again host [this event March 9-13, 2020.](https://h41382.www4.hpe.com/tss/)

If you plan on attending, you will receive up-to-the-minute training on product developments, roadmap updates, and strategic insights. You will even have opportunities to practice and apply your knowledge under non-disclosure. As evidenced by the schedule, many exciting sessions are planned.

The HPE DEV team will again be present at this event. We even have our own dedicated area, called the Hack Shack. It’s made up of a garden and a lab room, providing a cozy place where you can learn and have some fun. Many different activities will take place in the Hack Shack throughout the week. To discover more about the HPE DEV program, head straight to the Hack Shack desk. It opens at the same time as the Presales Suite, which is where attendees learn how HPE tools and resources make daily business easier and more effective. 

In the garden, we will host different code and game challenges where players compete with other players and coders for prizes. On Monday, you’ll find breakout sessions that describe the HPE DEV program and its importance to you.
