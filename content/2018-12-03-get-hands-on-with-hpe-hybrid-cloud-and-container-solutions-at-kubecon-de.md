KubeCon is the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s flagship conference, which gathers adopters and technologists from leading open source and cloud native communities for four days to further the education and advancement of cloud native computing. This year, HPE will be at [KubeCon 2018](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/co-located-events/) in Seattle, WA from December 10-13, 2018. 

From beginners to experts, join HPE for their workshops covering the basics of how to implement HPE hybrid cloud and container solutions. Don’t miss your chance to walk through the challenges of deploying and managing applications in hybrid cloud environments and get help from HPE’s experts in the following areas:

## End to End Hybrid Cloud Management using HPE OneSphere 

Digital disruption is having a profound effect on every company. IT departments are being asked to support an increasing number of providers and manage a faster application cadence. HPE OneSphere helps by providing a managed cloud layer on existing virtualized infrastructure and offers a single portal to manage a hybrid cloud and container environment. In this workshop, you’ll learn how HPE OneSphere, with its powerful REST API, can compose hybrid clouds capable of supporting both traditional and cloud-native applications.

## Storage for Containers

Come find out how HPE allows you to deploy a robust persistent storage layer with advanced data services for stateful containers on-premises and in the cloud using HPE 3PAR, Nimble, and Cloud Volumes.

## Containers with End-to-End Life Cycle using HPE Composable Infrastructure

HPE Composable Infrastructure provides the flexible infrastructure you need to incorporate container services into DevOps, host existing applications, add new micro services, and modernize legacy applications. It enables you to dynamically provision and scale applications, whether they run in VMs or containers. The software-defined architecture allows you to compose compute, storage, and networking resources to target specific workloads. And HPE Image Streamer enables stateless deployment of the operating system and other supporting software required to make the resources ready to run. Join this workshop to learn more.

## HPE ProLiant for Microsoft Azure Stack

Azure stack allows you to bring modern cloud services to your sensitive data and edge applications that may not yet be suitable for the public cloud. Join HPE experts to learn how the HPE ProLiant for Microsoft Azure Stack is a hybrid cloud solution that enables you to deliver Azure services from your data center.
