# Using the 3PAR SSMC/CLI & HPE 3PAR Ansible Module to Create and Manage Virtual Domains in a Multi-Tenant Scenario

This guide walks through the steps to create and manage Virtual Domains within a 3PAR using a mixture of the SSMC or CLI and the Ansible module for 3PAR. This guide targets those who want to setup and manage multi-tenancy on a 3PAR using configuration management tools like Ansible.

You can also find this content over at:

[https://github.com/hpe-storage/hpe3par-examples](https://github.com/hpe-storage/hpe3par-examples/tree/master/automation_tools/ansible/demo/virtual_domains)


## Assumptions<a name="assumptions"></a>
* HPE 3PAR configured and zoned correctly
* WSAPI enabled
* Super user access to 3PAR
* Ansible installed on workstation
* Knowledge of Ansible and playbooks

## Configuring Virtual Domains in SSMC<a name="virtualdomain"></a>

Domains allow an administrator to create up to 1,024 domains, or spaces, within a system, where each domain is dedicated to a specific application. A subset of the system users has assigned rights over the domains. Domains can be useful in scenarios where a single system is used to manage data from several different independent applications.
For more information, refer to the **HPE 3PAR Storeserv Storage Concepts Guide**.

The first steps to setting up your 3PAR for multi-tenancy is to create a new virtual domain. Currently the configuration of Domains/Users can only done within the SSMC or via the 3PAR CLI (using **createdomain \<domain\>**, **createuser \<username\> \<domainname\> \<role\>** ). The example shown below will be done within the SSMC.

1. Login into the SSMC with Super user access.  

![SSMC login](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/9/ssmc_login-1538420080349.jpg)

2. In the mega menu, click **Show All > Domains**

![3PAR domains](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/9/3par_domains-1538420435371.jpg)

3. Click **Create domain**

![domains](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/9/3par_domains_create-1538420530820.jpg)

4. Enter the name of the domain. In this example, `bob_domain`. Then click **Add systems**. Specify the **3PAR** where the domain will be created. Once complete, click **Create**.<a name="bob"></a>

>You may ask why I am using Bob, because everyone knows Bob is cool!<a name="bob"></a>

![create domain](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/9/3par_domains_create_bob_65-1538420610188.jpg)

5. In the mega menu, click **Show All > Users**

![users](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/9/3par_users_menu-1538420664979.jpg)

6. Click **Create User**

![create user](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/9/create_user-1538420731817.jpg)

7. Specify the **NEW** user name and password

![create bob_user](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/9/create_user_bob_65-1538420769787.jpg)

8. Click **Add Authorizations**, choose the domain created previously (`bob_domain` on **virt-3par** system). Choose the **edit** Role for the user. Click Add.

![authorization](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/9/add_authorization-1538420815894.jpg)

### Repeat these steps as necessary to configure additional Domains and Users within your 3PAR.


If you want to use Ansible to configure the domains and users, Ansible can pass CLI commands to the 3PAR using the `shell` module.

For example:


```YAML
---
- name: Create 3PAR Domain & Users
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: install sshpass
      package:
        name: sshpass
        state: present
      become: yes

    - name: Create Domain
      shell: /usr/bin/sshpass -p 3pardata ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no 3paradm@192.168.1.50 "createdomain bob_domain"
      register: domain

    - name: print domain
      debug:
        msg: "{{ domain }}"

    - name: Create Users
      shell: /usr/bin/sshpass -p 3pardata ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no 3paradm@192.168.1.50 "createuser -c Password1 bob_user bob_domain edit"
      register: users    

    - name: print users
      debug:
        msg: "{{ users }}"
```

# Using Ansible to configure CPGs, Hosts, Volumes and more<a name="ansible"></a>

The following section demonstrates the process to configure resources like **CPGs**, **3PAR hosts**, etc. and assign them to the newly created domain(s). Remember that the domain users are only be able to view/edit resources they have access to and are be unable to view/edit resources from other domains unless authorized to do so.

Also everything else from this point is done via the HPE 3PAR Ansible Storage Module on a Linux (RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu) system with Ansible (ver. 2.5 or later) installed.

## Storage Admin Perspective<a name="admin"></a>
---

### Let's get started.

First, we need to make sure we have the 3PAR storage module for Ansible downloaded.

1. Clone the HPE 3PAR Ansible Storage Modules

```
https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module
```

2. Install the HPE 3PAR Python SDK


```
pip install hpe3par_sdk
```

Now, clone the `hpe3par-examples` repo to get access to the Virtual Domain demo.


```
https://github.com/hpe-storage/hpe3par-examples
```


### Generic Ansible housekeeping<a name="housekeeping"></a>

1. Configure `ansible.cfg` to know about the 3PAR Ansible Storage Modules.

>If you have other modules already installed on this system, you can move the **Modules** folder from this repo to that directory.


```
vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
```

2. Under the `[defaults]` section, edit `library` to point to your Modules directory.


```
[defaults]

# some basic default values...

inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts
library        = /root/workspace/hpe3par_ansible_module/Modules
```
---


### Understanding the 3PAR Ansible playbooks<a name="understanding"></a>

Navigate to the `hpe3par_examples/automation_tools/ansible/demo/virtual_domains` folder. Here we find two Ansible playbooks and the `properties/` folder.

* **virtual_domains_demo_3par_admin.yml**
* **virtual_domains_demo_3par_user.yml**
* **properties/storage_system_properties.yml** (This is configuration files containing the 3PAR IP address, Storage admin username and password for the 3PAR array)
* **properties/storage_system_properties_bob.yml** (This is configuration files containing the 3PAR IP address, Domain user username and password for the 3PAR array)


```
cd ~/workspace/hpe3par_examples/automation_tools/ansible/

[root@ansible-host virtual_domains]# ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root  137 Sep 26 13:00 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root   29 Sep 26 09:23 ..
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  254 Sep 26 13:00 img
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  116 Sep 26 09:23 properties
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2219 Sep 26 13:00 README.md
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2065 Sep 26 09:23 virtual_domains_demo_3par_admin.yml
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2065 Sep 26 09:23 virtual_domains_demo_3par_create-domain-users_cli.yml
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1847 Sep 26 09:23 virtual_domains_demo_3par_user.yml
```
---


### Configuring Storage System Property files

1. Lets configure the `properties/storage_system_properties.yml` and add the 3PAR IP address. Enter the **Storage Admin** username and password. Save the file.


```
vi **properties/storage_system_properties.yml**
```


```
storage_system_ip: "192.168.1.50"
storage_system_username: "3paradm"
storage_system_password: "3pardata"
```

2. Edit the `properties/storage_system_properties_bob.yml` and configure the 3PAR IP address. Enter the **bob_user** username and password. Save the file.


```
vi **properties/storage_system_properties_bob.yml**
```


```
storage_system_ip: "192.168.1.50"
storage_system_username: "bob_user"
storage_system_password: "Password"
```
---


### Configuring Ansible Vault - encrypt/decrypt

Ansible Vault is a feature of ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than as plaintext in playbooks or roles.

1. Run `ansible-vault encrypt` on each of the properties files. Enter a unique password for each file.


```
ansible-vault encrypt properties/storage_system_properties.yml

ansible-vault encrypt properties/storage_system_properties_bob.yml
```

2. Check to verify they are encrypted. You should see something similar to below.


```
$ head -2 properties/storage_system_properties.yml
$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
33636137356335
```

>**Note:** If you need to edit the encrypted file, you can run `ansible-vault edit file.yml`, enter the vault password and perform the edits. Alternatively, if you need to decrypt the file, run `ansible-vault decrypt file.yml` and enter the vault password.

---


### Now let's get on to the fun stuff

We will be working in the `virtual_domains_demo_3par_admin.yml` playbook. This playbook is ran by the Storage Admin to create **CPGs** and assign **Hosts** to the domain we created previously.

>**Note:** These are very simple examples to help you understand the capabilities of the Virtual Domains within the HPE 3PAR system. You can expand these to add multiple CPGs and multiple Hosts within the same playbook without ever having to log into the SSMC. This is the power automating the configuration of the HPE 3PAR Storage System using the Ansible Storage Modules.

When we open the file, we see multiple sections. Again we are assuming that you are familiar with **YAML** and Ansible playbooks to understand the layout and structure.


```yaml
---
- name: Virtual Domains on 3PAR Ansible Demo playbook - Admin
  hosts: localhost
  become: no

  vars:
    cpg_name: 'bob_cpg_FC_r6'
    host_name: 'scom.virtware.co'
    domain: 'bob_domain'
    iscsi_names: 'iqn.1991-05.com.microsoft:scom.virtware.co'

  tasks:
    - name: Load Storage System Vars
      include_vars: 'properties/storage_system_properties.yml'

    - name: Create CPG "{{ cpg_name }}"
      hpe3par_cpg:
        # 3PAR CPG options found here: https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module#modules
        storage_system_ip: "{{ storage_system_ip }}"
        storage_system_username: "{{ storage_system_username }}"
        storage_system_password: "{{ storage_system_password }}"
        state: present
        domain: "{{ domain }}"
        cpg_name: "{{ cpg_name }}"
        growth_increment: 32.5
        growth_increment_unit: GiB
        growth_limit: 100
        growth_limit_unit: GiB
        growth_warning: 90
        growth_warning_unit: GiB
        raid_type: R6
        set_size: 6
        high_availability: MAG
        disk_type: FC

    - name: Create Host "{{ host_name }}"
      hpe3par_host:
        # 3PAR Host options found here: https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module#modules
        storage_system_ip: "{{ storage_system_ip }}"
        storage_system_username: "{{ storage_system_username }}"
        storage_system_password: "{{ storage_system_password }}"
        state: present
        host_name: "{{ host_name }}"
        host_domain: "{{ domain }}"
        host_persona: WINDOWS_SERVER

    - name: Add iSCSI paths to Host "{{ host_name }}"
      hpe3par_host:
        storage_system_ip: "{{ storage_system_ip }}"
        storage_system_username: "{{ storage_system_username }}"
        storage_system_password: "{{ storage_system_password }}"
        state: add_iscsi_path_to_host
        host_name: "{{ host_name }}"
        host_iscsi_names: "{{ iscsi_names }}"

```  
---


### Configuring Variables section

There are several sections where you can specify variables allowing maximum flexibility when creating playbooks. They can be specified at the **playbook** level (Global), in **external file** (properties/storage_system_properties.yml), or at the **task** level.

In the `vars` section, you can modify the CPG/Host names to be added to the `bob_domain`.

**Note:** In order to assign the new CPGs and Hosts to the domain, you must specify a domain in the `domain: 'bob_domain'` variable. This variable is then used within each of the tasks (**domain:** and **host_domain:**), where required, to assign the CPG or Host to the domain. If the domain is **not** specified, the CPG or Host is **not** assigned to a domain and is not accessible to the Domain user when they log into the array.

> Modify the **host_name** and **iscsi_names** to match a host and iSCSI iqns you want to add from your environment.

In the `tasks` section, for example in the **Create CPG** task, you can add/modify the variables (growth_limit, raid_type, etc) in the tasks as well move them into **vars** section if needed.

> In the case of Multi-Tenancy, creating growth limits, defining disk characteristics on CPGs in critical in order to enforce boundaries per tenant (this prevents one tenant from consuming the entire storage array), as well as to ensure all tenants get the appropriate resources and performance per their needs. In the playbook above, we specified a **100GB growth limit (with a 90GB warning)** on the CPG, therefore restricting the users within the `bob_domain` from using more than 100GB of storage space on the array. All of this is configurable by the Storage Admin.

Also you can specify an external variables file like the `storage_system_properties.yml`. This gives us the ability to encrypt the external file without affecting the main playbook.

---


### Configuring Tasks sections<a name="admin_tasks"></a>

We have 4 main tasks in this example.

These tasks are taken from the main (CPG, Host, Volume, etc) playbooks found in the 3PAR Storage Module here: [https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module/tree/master/playbooks](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module/tree/master/playbooks).

Please refer to the [Modules README](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module/blob/master/Modules/readme.md) for detailed information on each Module including required/optional parameters.

1. **Load Storage System Vars** (load the encrypted storage system IP, username/password)
2. **Create CPG** (create CPGs per the provided specifications)
3. **Create Host** (create a basic 3PAR host)
4. **Add iSCSI paths to Host** (modify the host and add iSCSI IQNs or FC WWNs)
---

### Running the Playbook<a name="admin_run"></a>
Now that we know what is going on within the admin playbook, we can run it in order to create the CPGs, Host resources within the **bob_domain**.

We run this playbook with the `ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass` option in order to decrypt the `storage_system_properties.yml` file.


```yaml
$ ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass virtual_domains_demo_3par_admin.yml
Vault password:

PLAY [Virtual Domains on 3PAR Ansible Demo playbook - Admin] **************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ****************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

```
---


### Success.

This sample playbook demonstrates how a Storage Admin can quickly and programmatically configure Domains, Users, and storage resources using a combination of the SSMC and Ansible playbooks.



## Storage User Perspective<a name="user"></a>
---

Now that we have finished configuring a Domain, Users, created CPGs and added hosts into the Domain, lets cover how a user can consume the 3PAR using Ansible playbooks while still being bound to the limits placed on the domain by the Storage Admin.

This section follows closely to my other blog post about using the Ansible modules to provision storage on an HPE 3PAR. [Storage Provisioning using Ansible with HPE 3PAR Storage](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/storage-provisioning-using-ansible-with-hpe-3par-storage)

### Assumptions<a name="user_assumptions"></a>
  * Domains/users have been created
  * CPGs and Hosts have been assigned to the domain
  * Reviewed [Generic Ansible housekeeping](#housekeeping) section
  * Vault password to unlock the **properties/storage_system_properties_bob.yml** file. Check out the [Vault section](#vault) for more info.


### Let's get started

Let's take a look at our Ansible playbooks again. Since we have everything ready for us on the array, it is very simple to run the playbooks as a user. The example playbook is a simple demonstration on how you can turn your **Infrastructure into Code**.

* Navigate to the **hpe3par_examples/automation_tools/ansible/demo/virtual_domains** folder.


```
cd hpe3par_examples/automation_tools/ansible/demo/virtual_domains
```

Here we find the `virtual_domains_demo_3par_user.yml` playbook and the `properties/storage_system_properties_bob.yml` (This file contains the 3PAR IP address, 3PAR Domain user username/password).


```
[root@ansible-host virtual_domains]# ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root  137 Sep 26 13:00 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root   29 Sep 26 09:23 ..
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  254 Sep 26 13:00 img
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  116 Sep 26 09:23 properties
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2219 Sep 26 13:00 README.md
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2065 Sep 26 09:23 virtual_domains_demo_3par_admin.yml
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2065 Sep 26 09:23 virtual_domains_demo_3par_create-domain-users_cli.yml
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1847 Sep 26 09:23 virtual_domains_demo_3par_user.yml
```

Before we go much further, make sure you have configured the `properties/storage_system_properties_bob.yml` with the appropriate 3PAR array information. Please review [Storage System Property Files](#property) for more info.

Let's look at the 'virtual_domains_demo_3par_user.yml' playbook.


```
vi virtual_domains_demo_3par_user.yaml
```

When we open the file, we see multiple sections. Again we are assuming that you are familiar with **YAML** and Ansible playbooks to understand the layout and structure.


```yaml
---
- name: Virtual Domains on 3PAR Ansible Demo playbook - Bob User
  hosts: localhost

  vars:
    volume_name: 'bob_demo_volume'
    cpg_name: 'bob_cpg_FC_r6'
    host_name: 'scom.virtware.co'
    domain: 'bob_domain'
    vol_size: 10
    vol_size_unit: 'GiB'
    autolun: False
    lunid: 110

  tasks:
    - name: Load Storage System Vars
      include_vars: 'properties/storage_system_properties_bob.yml'

    - name: Load VolumeSet Vars
      include_vars: 'properties/volumeset_properties.yml'

    - name: Create Volume "{{ volume_name }}"
      hpe3par_volume:
        storage_system_ip: "{{ storage_system_ip }}"
        storage_system_username: "{{ storage_system_username }}"
        storage_system_password: "{{ storage_system_password }}"
        state: present
        volume_name: "{{ item }}"
        cpg: "{{ cpg_name }}"
        size: "{{ vol_size }}"
        size_unit: "{{ vol_size_unit }}"
      with_items: "{{ ['volume_bob_1', 'volume_bob_2', 'volume_bob_3'] }}"

    - name: Create volume set "{{ volumeset_name }}"
      hpe3par_volumeset:
        storage_system_ip: "{{ storage_system_ip }}"
        storage_system_username: "{{ storage_system_username }}"
        storage_system_password: "{{ storage_system_password }}"
        state: present
        volumeset_name: "{{ volumeset_name }}"
        setmembers: "{{ add_vol_setmembers }}"

    - name: Create VLUN
      hpe3par_vlun:
        storage_system_ip: "{{ storage_system_ip }}"
        storage_system_username: "{{ storage_system_username }}"
        storage_system_password: "{{ storage_system_password }}"
        state: export_volumeset_to_host
        volume_set_name: "{{ volumeset_name }}"
        host_name: "{{ host_name }}"
        lunid: "{{ lunid }}"
        autolun: "{{ autolun }}"
```        


The sections within the user playbook are very similar to the one used by the admin user. From this playbook, you are able to provision volumes from the CPGs and resources specified by the Storage Admin ([100GB limit](#limits)) and exporting the volumes to hosts. The main difference here is that you are authenticating to the 3PAR with a 3PAR Domain user (**bob_user**) rather than a 3PAR Super user.

The 3PAR Domain user is specified in the `properties/storage_system_properties_bob.yml` file. This is covered in the [Storage System Property Files](#property) section.

---


### Configuring Variables section - User

A quick review on variables. There are several sections where you can specify variables allowing maximum flexibility when creating playbooks. They can be specified at the playbook level (Global), in external file (properties/storage_system_properties.yml), or at the task level.

In the `vars` section, you can modify the **Volume**, **CPG**, **3PAR Host**, **Volume Size**, etc. to meet your needs.

>Be aware, if you exceed the 100GB limit on the CPG (as defined by the Storage Admin in our demo), by either creating a volume larger than 100GB or multiple volumes that exceed a cumulative 100GB in size, the playbook fails with an error that the allocation is larger than the limit.

**Note:** Since we are logged into the `bob_domain` as the `bob_user`, we don't have to explicitly define the domain when creating Volumes, Volume Sets, etc. because the domain is inherited from the User's domain.

In the `tasks` section, for example in the **Create Volume** task, you can use the `with_items` option (with_items functions as a loop in Ansible) to create multiple volumes during runtime rather creating multiple tasks to create individual volumes.

---


### Configuring Tasks sections - User<a name="user_tasks"></a>

We have 4 main tasks in this example.

These tasks are taken from the main (CPG, Host, Volume, etc) playbooks found in the 3PAR Storage Module here:  [https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module/tree/master/playbooks](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module/tree/master/playbooks).

Please refer to the [Modules README](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module/blob/master/Modules/readme.md) for detailed information on each Module including optional parameters.

1. **Load Storage System Vars** (load the encrypted storage system IP, username/password)
2. **Load VolumeSet Variables**
2. **Create Volume** (create 3 Volumes as defined)
3. **Create VolumeSet** (create a VolumeSet for the 3 Volumes)
4. **Create VLUN** (Export the VolumeSet to the 3PAR Host (i.e. scom.virtware.co))
---


### Running the Playbook - User<a name="user_run"></a>
Now that we have configured our playbook, we can run it in order to create the **Volumes**, **VolumeSet** all within the `bob_domain`.

We run this playbook with the `ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass` option in order to decrypt the **storage_system_properties_bob.yml** file.


```yaml
$ ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass virtual_domains_demo_3par_user.yml
Vault password:

PLAY [Virtual Domains on 3PAR Ansible Demo playbook - Bob User] *************************

```
---


### Success.<a name="user_success"></a>

This sample playbook demonstrates how a Storage User can quickly and programmatically provision storage and manage those storage resources within their Domain while still being under the control of the Storage Admin.

Now let's verify that these volumes have been exported to the Host.

1. Log into the **SSMC** as `bob_user`

2. Click on **Virtual Volumes**. You should see 3 volumes and also see that they are successfully exported to **scom.virtware.co**

![Success SSMC](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/9/ssmc_success-1538420946527.jpg)
