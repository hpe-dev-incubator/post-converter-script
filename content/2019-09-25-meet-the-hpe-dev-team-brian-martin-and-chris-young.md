In this edition of our Meet the HPE DEV Team blog, I’d like you to meet Brian Martin and Chris Young, members of the [HPE Dev Community.](https://developer.hpe.com/community) Both HPE DEV Community members have a strong background in [HPE Composable Fabric,](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/composable-fabric.html#targetText=HPE%20Composable%20Fabric%20removes%20performance,infrastructure%20as%20needed%2C%20when%20needed.) an intelligent networking system that removes performance bottlenecks and empowers developers, administrators, and application owners to deliver applications faster. The technology also lets you scale infrastructure as needed, when needed.

__Brian Martin – automation expert by day, spider robot builder by night__

Brian spent four years in partner engineering and product management for HPE Composable Fabric Manager prior to his recent transition to the Global Service Mesh Initiative (aka [cloudless](https://www.labs.hpe.com/page/cloudless)) where he now acts as an architect and rapid prototyper. As part of the HPE DEV community, he’s enjoyed helping folks learn how to interface with HPE Composable Fabric Manager directly through REST, Swagger, Curl commands, Python bindings, and the StackStorm integration pack. 

Brian’s interest in automated sensing extends into his personal life with his work on spider robots. I was impressed to learn that Brian has built a six-legged crawling platform that features a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster for processing that can be used for autonomous exploration. He’s currently working on a new wheeled version, which is based on a modified Mars Rover design for faster travel and stair climbing.  It features two bogies (a special a special suspension mechanism designed for land mobile platforms) instead of one. Brian also works with health and education charities and non-profits, assisting with their technology needs and encouraging science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) interests by building robots with kids.

__Chris Young – automation enthusiast who uses expertise to save money__

As part of the Solutions Architecture team, Chris is focused on integrating enterprise applications with HPE Composable Fabric Manager. Chris admires how the automation delivered through products like this helps enhance people’s lives by ensuring accuracy, optimizing efficiency, and relieving stress. Chris values automation, both for business as well as other facets of his life, including his home. 

As an Internet-of-Things (IoT) enthusiast, Chris has set up approximately 150 sensors throughout his home to monitor things like power, temperature, and the environment. He’s even set up orchestrated lights to help his children get out of bed in the morning. His goal is for the house to proactively adapt to what’s going on in the environment. In addition to the quality of life improvements, he’s already cut $1000 off his energy bill through monitoring and orchestration of the home environment. 

Chris sees similar benefits coming out of the Composable Fabric product line, given the network’s ability to sense what’s happening in the environment and take appropriate actions. Chris tweets regularly. Consider connecting with him [@netmanchris](https://twitter.com/netmanchris?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), if only to hear about his IoT exploits.

To get a better sense of who Brian and Chris are, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTswJtJGCoc&feature=youtu.be) and hear what they have to say. And, if you ever have questions on HPE Composable Fabric, don’t be afraid to reach out to Brian or Chris on [Slack.](https://slack.hpedev.io/)
