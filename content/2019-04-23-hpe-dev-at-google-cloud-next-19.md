Sir Hackington Appbuilder III here. As an important member of the HPE Developer Community (HPE DEV), I get to travel to a lot of shows and hang out with event attendees. I just got back from #GoogleNext19 and wanted to tell you all about it!

[Google Cloud Next '19](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf) April 9-11, 2019 in Moscone Center, San Francisco brought together some of brightest minds in tech for three full days of networking, learning, and problem solving. Thousands of IT professionals and executives across industries participated. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) commanded a presence at the event with an [ important announcement on groundbreaking partnerships that help simplify the pathway to hybrid cloud.](http://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/partners/google-cloud-partners-with-hpe-on-hybrid-cloud-next19) 
 
On the first day, HPE announced that it would further expand its commitment to deliver the options and the experiences customers desire for hybrid cloud by strategically aligning with two powerful industry players – Nutanix and Google Cloud, These partnerships help to extend the fast growing, ever-evolving HPE GreenLake ecosystem. The partnerships aims to provide customers with a consistent experience across public cloud and on premises environments.

A key part of the announcement brought developer event attendees to the HPE DEV booth to ask about next steps and how they could participate. HPE will offer validated designs for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) based on [ HPE SimpliVity ](http://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/simplivity.html) hyperconverged solutions and many developers came to the HPE booth looking for information on how to interact with HPE SimpliVity using the HPE APIs.

HPE DEV booth personnel were happy to interact with the attendees, showing them the HPE DEV portal and where they could find the tools they need. A few folks came in just to see me. One kind person even took me for a walk.

There was also quite an interest in [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/) Attendees expressed their excitement about how HPE was supporting open source and provided feedback from having used the UI framework. The use of Grommet seems to be a grassroots engagement starting with new users. Attendees seemed equally delighted to obtain Grommet stickers, as well as stickers for other HPE products. 

The highlight of each day was the daily prize giveaway where, through a raffle, one lucky event attendee walked away with an Argon Raspberry Pi kit just for having signed up for the HPE DEV newsletter.
