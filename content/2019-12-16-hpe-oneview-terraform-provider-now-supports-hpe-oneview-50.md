[HPE OneView](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html) Terraform provider v1.2.0 now supports HPE OneView 5.0 (REST API version 1200). [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), by [HashiCorp,](https://www.hashicorp.com/) is a popular tool for infrastructure automation that facilitates a multicloud or hybrid cloud approach to infrastructure management. When integrated with HPE OneView, Terraform is a powerful orchestration tool that can be used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources. These resources may be physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, or others.

HPE OneView Terraform provider automates the provisioning of physical infrastructure on-demand using software-defined templates from HPE OneView. This enables administrators to create a resource topology similar to that of a public cloud on their own physical infrastructure. With this type of resource topology, administrators can easily migrate applications and workloads to an on-premises private cloud environment to realize their hybrid cloud strategy.
