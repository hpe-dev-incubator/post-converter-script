Digital transformation has flipped the industry’s focus from hardware-centricity to a software-defined reality. What makes up the server, and where it’s located, is no longer as important as what’s running on it and how seamlessly these applications can be accessed and used across the infrastructure. No matter how the infrastructure fabric is woven throughout on premise and cloud resources, the most important thing is to ensure the best user experience (UX). 

As a new member of the HPE DEV team, I was excited to learn about the great work that’s coming out of this group. This high-energy team is dedicated to the continuous improvement of both software development and UX design.  Whether the software is being developed internally to HPE or is open source code – these folks are here to help. 

Modern collaborative DevOps methods have fundamentally changed software development processes, providing more efficient, modular processes that enable quicker time to market and allow developers to respond to customer’s needs faster. Additionally, these processes focus more on the importance of the user experience. After all, this is where customers live – at the user interface. 

With the shift to a more developer-centric mindset, HPE is empowering developers to manage infrastructure as code more effectively. Building an open source community allows HPE DEV engineers to work with developers directly to incorporate [Design-Thinking](http://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-design-thinking-and-why-is-it-so-popular) principles that will help the developers produce better applications for their customers.

When I joined this team, I found it interesting that both development AND design were combined in the same group. In my experience, developers and designers spoke very different languages. This is partly because the skills that make a successful programmer aren’t the same as those required to create a good UI. But then I learned about [Grommet](http://v2.grommet.io/)– a set of libraries that enable consistency in the design of code and application UIs, giving both designers and developers a way to inject consistent user experiences into enterprise apps easily. This open source UI dev tool is now being used by internal HPE and external developers to build enterprise applications that can be used in a variety of formats: web, desktop, and mobile. It also permeates HPE’s cloud and software-defined management products.

As HPE continues to find better ways to work more closely with developers, you’ll see more coming out of this organization. The HPE DEV and design teams can connect you to HPE subject matter experts and resources. They can also help you develop software and solutions that improve automation, service delivery, and workflows, as well as your UX design. Maybe you’re new like me. If so, welcome to our newsletter! For those of you who have known us for a while, it would be great to connect and hear about some of your experiences with our team.
