[HPE OneView 5.2](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html) (REST API version 1600) automation features are now supported by all of the HPE OneView SDKs. HPEâ€™s Composable Ecosystem actively supports [Ansible](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-ansible), [Python](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-python), [Golang](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-golang), [Terraform](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview/releases/tag/v1.3.0), [Chef](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-chef), [Puppet](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-puppet), [PowerShell](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/POSH-HPOneView) and [Ruby](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-sdk-ruby) SDKs. Using the unified HPE OneView API and these popular tools, IT administrators can deploy and update servers, storage, and networking simultaneously, using only a single line of code. Composing new infrastructure is now not only faster and more agile, but also more predictable.  

[HPE OneView](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html) uses software-defined intelligence in a template-driven approach to automate the deployment, provisioning, updating, and integration of resources, such as compute, storage, and networking infrastructure. Designed with a modern, standards-based API, HPE OneView gives IT organizations the ability to connect their software-defined infrastructure from core to cloud within a diverse partner ecosystem. IT organizations can leverage this partner ecosystem to integrate HPE OneView within their existing management frameworks for their preferred platforms.   

HPE offers SDKs for industry-leading software deployment, provisioning, and configuration management tools, including Ansible, Terraform, Chef and Puppet. These SDKs can be used to configure HPE OneView managed infrastructure resources. IT organizations can use these SDKs to streamline the task of configuring and maintaining a company's servers. The SDKs allow for integration with cloud-based platforms to automatically provision and configure new machines, enabling administrators to create a resource topology similar to that of a public cloud on their own physical infrastructure.   

Developers can programmatically control HPE OneView managed resources using infrastructure-as-code for physical compute, storage, and fabric resources. Infrastructure-as-code enables complete datacenter automation, consistent reproducibility, versioning, and roll back.  

The HPE OneView SDKs also provide API language support for Python, Ruby, Golang and PowerShell languages, enabling developers to easily build integrations and scalable solutions with HPE OneView. With language support, you can integrate popular automation tools based on these languages with HPE OneView.
