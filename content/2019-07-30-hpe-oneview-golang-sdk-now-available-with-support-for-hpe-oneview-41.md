[HPE OneView](https://hpe.com/info/oneview) takes
a software-defined, programmatic approach to managing infrastructure with efficient workflow automation, a modern RESTful API, and a comprehensive partner ecosystem. The HPE OneView Golang SDK v1.0.0 now supports HPE OneView 4.1 (REST API version 800). The HPE OneView Golang SDK extends the HPE OneView API language support to include the [go language](https://golang.org), which is rapidly increasing in adoption and a popular favorite for cloud native applications.

The SDK allows go developers to programmatically control HPE OneView managed resources using an infrastructure-as-code approach for physical compute, storage, and fabric resources. Benefits of this infrastructure-as-code approach include, complete datacenter automation, consistent reproducibility, versioning, and roll back.
