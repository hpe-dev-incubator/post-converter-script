The HPE OneView Golang SDK v1.2.0 now supports HPE OneView 5.0 (REST API version 1200). The HPE OneView Golang SDK extends the HPE OneView API language support for the [go language,](https://golang.org/) which is popular for cloud-native applications. With language support, you can integrate popular tools based on Golang, such as Terraform with HPE OneView. [HPE OneView](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html) takes a software-defined, programmatic approach to managing infrastructure with efficient workflow automation, a modern RESTful API, and a comprehensive partner ecosystem.

The HPE OneView Golang SDK allows developers who use the go language to programmatically control HPE OneView managed resources using infrastructure-as-code for physical compute, storage, and fabric resources. Infrastructure-as-code enables complete datacenter automation, consistent reproducibility, versioning, and roll back.
