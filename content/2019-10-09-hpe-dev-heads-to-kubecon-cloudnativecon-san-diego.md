HPE DEV is gearing up for [KubeCon | CloudNativeCon North America,](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/) a major open source developer conference focused on furthering the education and advancement of Kubernetes and cloud native computing. As evidenced by the [schedule,](https://kccncna19.sched.com/) a ton of exciting sessions are planned for this November 18-21 event in San Diego, California.

A cross-organizational team from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) will staff the booth (P28) aimed at promoting and educating attendees on what HPE offers in the areas of containers and Kubernetes (k8s). Attendees will get the opportunity to talk with representatives from HPE DEV, HPE Storage and other HPE business areas. 

BlueData, a leading provider of container-based software solutions that HPE recently acquired to accelerate AI and data-driven innovation in the enterprise, will also be there. Tom Phelan, Chief Architect and co-founder of BlueData, [recently expressed his excitement](https://twitter.com/tapbluedata/status/1169810013851795456?s=20) in being selected, along with his colleague, Joel Baxter, to talk about the [KubeDirector](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/complex-stateful-applications-on-kubernetes-kubedirector-version-02) open source project at the event.
