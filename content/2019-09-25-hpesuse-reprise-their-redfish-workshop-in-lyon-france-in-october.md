HPE Open Source and Linux Technology Strategist, Bruno Cornec will once again be a speaker at the [upcoming Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2019/) in Lyon, October 28th – 30th, 2019. His hands-on lab will help attendees learn more about Docker and how to use containers. As he did at the previous summit held in [San Diego last August,](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/redfish-workshop-at-the-open-source-summit-na-2019) Bruno will also act as the coordinator for the co-located HPE+SUSE Redfish Workshop.

This [Redfish Workshop](http://trac.project-builder.org/wiki/RedfishWSEurope2019) will take place immediately after the summit on Thursday, October 31, 2019 from 9:00am – 5:00pm at the Lyon Convention Centre. At the event, system administrators, architects, and developers can see live demos, learn how to use Redfish, and interact with [Redfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfish_(specification)) Project technical experts. 

System and software engineers, developers, and administrators can all benefit from knowledgeable speakers who will point out the benefits derived from a standard management layer that can be used to deploy, configure, and manage an environment. Other topics will also be covered, including the use of DMTF tools for system configuration and the REST API to perform Redfish operations from Python. Attendees will get the chance to practice the concepts being presented through interactive sessions, demos, and labs.

This is a free event, sponsored by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and SUSE.
