With our newest update, all of the HPE OneView Ecosystem SDKs now support [HPE OneView 5.3](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html?chatsrc=ot-en&jumpid=ps_ixkqsmug5a_aid-520023673&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpPL8tqD16QIVUfDACh0i3g6WEAAYASAAEgLJ-_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)  (REST API version 1800) automation features. The HPE OneView Ecosystem actively supports [Ansible](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-ansible), [Python](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-python), [Golang](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-golang), [Terraform](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview/releases/tag/v1.3.0), [Chef](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-chef), [Puppet](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-puppet), [PowerShell](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/POSH-HPOneView), and [Ruby](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-sdk-ruby) SDKs.  The updated SDKs allow IT organizations to leverage the latest HPE OneView features and provide the ability to automate software-defined infrastructure from core to cloud. With such a diverse partner ecosystem, IT organizations benefit from being able to integrate HPE OneView within their preferred platform's existing management frameworks.

[HPE OneView](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html)  uses software-defined intelligence via a template-driven approach to automate the deployment, provisioning, updating, and integration of resources, such as compute, storage, and networking infrastructure. Designed with a modern, standards-based API, HPE OneView enables IT administrators to deploy and update using only a single line of code. This makes composing new infrastructure not only faster and more agile, but also more predictable.
<br/>
HPE offers SDKs for industry-leading software deployment, provisioning, and configuration management tools, including Ansible, Terraform, Chef, and Puppet. HPE also provides API language support for Python, Ruby, Golang, and PowerShell languages. Developers can therefore easily build integrations, custom automations and scalable solutions. The SDKs allow for integration with cloud-based platforms to automatically provision and configure new machines, enabling administrators to create a resource topology similar to that of a public cloud on their own physical infrastructure.
<br/>
To simplify installation and maintenance for customers with container environments.  HPE OneView 5.3 SDKs are available as Docker images. [Ansible](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-ansible), [Terraform](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-terraform), [Chef](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-chef), [Puppet](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-puppet), [Python](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-python), [Golang](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-golang), and [Ruby](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-ruby) SDKs are now all available on Docker Hub. All prerequisite materials are incorporated into the container images to enable streamlined deployment, which will simplify maintenance, improve infrastructure agility, and reduce costs.
