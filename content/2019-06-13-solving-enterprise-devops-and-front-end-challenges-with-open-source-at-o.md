For over 20 years, the [O’Reilly Open Source Software Conference (OSCON)](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/content/about) has been the focal point of the open source movement, earning a reputation as the destination for all things free and open. OSCON welcomes anyone who’s passionate about open source; from software developers, designers, and architects, to activists, hackers, and geeks. This year the event will take place in Portland, Oregon, from July 15 – 19, 2019.

Some may be surprised to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) at an event like OSCON, but those “in the know” will recognize HPE as a leading innovator who has a lot to offer open source software development and design teams. Attendees will get a chance to see how an HPE-developed, easy-to-use open source component library, like [Grommet,](https://v2.grommet.io/) can be used to create responsive, mobile-first projects.

At this year’s OSCON event, Pramod Sareddy, Full-stack Developer for HPE DEV, will present [“Solving enterprise DevOps and front end challenges with open source”.](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/78263) For those planning to attend, make sure you catch his talk starting at 11:00 am on Wednesday, July 17th. Pramod will also show the audience how Open Service Broker (OSB) can save time and effort by exposing a web development framework. 

OSCON attendees can expect to hear from innovative programmers, talented managers, and senior developers who are all doing amazing things with open source. The event features over a hundred sessions that cover a full range of open source languages and platforms, including practical tutorials designed to enhance technical skills. With fun evening events and receptions, Birds of a Feather sessions, awards ceremonies, late night parties, and OSCON activities around town, there will be plenty of learning and networking opportunities for everyone.

Check out all the [sessions](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/schedule/2019-07-15) and conference [events](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/stype/1350) that are planned. I hope to see  you there.
