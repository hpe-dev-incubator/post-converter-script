[HPE OneView](https://hpe.com/info/oneview) Terraform provider v1.0.1 now supports HPE OneView 4.1 (REST API version 800). [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/), is a popular tool for infrastructure automation and is rapidly increasing in adoption. The Terraform community includes a large number of providers that facilitate a multicloud or hybrid cloud approach to infrastructure management. As part of the HPE OneView comprehensive partner ecosystem, Terraform is a powerful orchestration tool used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources. These resources may be physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, or others.

HPE OneView Terraform provider automates the provisioning of physical infrastructure on-demand using software-defined templates from HPE OneView. One way administrators could use this to their benefit would be to create a resource topology similar to that of a public cloud on their own physical infrastructure. By creating the resource topology this way, it's easier for administrators to migrate applications and workloads to an on-premise, private cloud as part of a hybrid cloud strategy.
