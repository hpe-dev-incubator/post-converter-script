Bruno Cornec, the HPE Open Source and Linux Technology Strategist, will be speaking at the [upcoming Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america-2019/)  in San Diego, August 21st – 23rd, 2019. He will deliver two sessions – one on Docker (a hands-on lab that’s designed to help you understand what it means to containerize) and one on Redfish. Bruno will also act as the coordinator for the co-located, first-ever HPE+SUSE Redfish Workshop. 

The [Redfish Workshop](http://trac.project-builder.org/wiki/RedfishWSNA2019) is a one day event, held Tuesday, August 20, 2019 from 9:00am – 5:00pm at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. At the event, you can see live demos and interact with [Redfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfish_(specification)) Project technical experts. In this workshop, system administrators, architects, and developers can learn how to use Redfish and about the benefit derived from a standard management layer to deploy, configure, and manage an environment.

Knowledgeable and engaging speakers will help you better understand topics like using DMTF tools for system configuration and using the REST API to perform Redfish operations from Python. You’ll also get clued into the latest news on the standard and its future evolution. Through interactive sessions, demos, and labs, you’ll get the chance to better understand and practice the concepts being presented.

This is a free event, sponsored by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and SUSE.
