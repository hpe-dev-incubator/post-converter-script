# An Insider’s Look into the HPE Aspire 2019 Experience

*By Pramod Sareddy*

Recently, I was fortunate enough to join over 2,000 Solution and Technology Architect professionals who gathered at the [HPE Aspire 2019](http://www.hpeaspire.com/) internal employee and partner conference. The event was held May 19-23 at the [Swan and Dolphin Resort](https://www.swandolphin.com/) in Orlando, Florida. While there, event attendees enjoyed four days focused on growing their Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) product and solution technical expertise and connecting with HPE engineers and subject matter experts (SMEs), as well as other industry specialists.

The HPE DEV booth shared space with other HPE and sponsor booths in the HPE Aspire Showcase. In the booth we were able to meet, collaborate, and network with event sponsors and other members of the HPE community, including [Tech Pro presales support](https://techpro.hpe.com/hpelogin.aspx?HPPSESSION=NO). The theme for this year’s show was "HPE Aspire Legends" and revolved around legendary characters from movies, sports, music, and television. Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean even made a personal appearance! During the keynote, we all enjoyed a dance performance. The event hosts thought of everything – even providing us with HPE-branded bread as a snack between meals.

In addition to fielding questions from sales reps while working the booth, I was approached by a number of HPE employees interested in the [HPE DEV portal](https://developer.hpe.com/). HPE software engineers were happy to see us there and showed a strong interest in digging deeper and contributing content. Based on our discussions, some are now considering posting scripts that they developed to connect their products to [HPE OneView](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html). [Aruba Networks](https://www.arubanetworks.com/) engineers expressed interest in becoming more closely aligned with the HPE DEV portal as well.
One HPE presales engineer was very excited to see that specific API documentation his developer customers had been searching for was easily accessible on HPE DEV. I pointed out that we had not only HPE OneView and [HPE Synergy](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/synergy.html) material, but also information on other platforms, like [HPE SimpliVity](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/simplivity.html) and [HPE Nimble Storage](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/storage/nimble.html), including all the supporting tools and modules.

All in all, it was a great opportunity to showcase the wide variety of resources HPE DEV provides.
