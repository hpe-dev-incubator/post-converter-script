The world has changed, shifting everyone’s priorities. Digital transformation is no longer something that’s being planned. It’s something that is *imperative*, **now**. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is here to help. HPE Discover offers you the opportunity to connect with subject matter experts and explore solutions through instructor-led workshops to help you realize how HPE can help move your business forward. 

This year, HPE is bringing [HPE Discover](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/discover.html) to you as an on-going virtual experience, offering more opportunities for customers to attend from all over the world – free of charge. We will be kicking off the event on June 23rd and producing it across three different time zones. As part of the virtual experience, you’ll be given the opportunity to view important keynotes, check out what’s new, and hear from key industry analysts. Best of all, you’ll get to experience the all-new, virtual HPE DEV Hack Shack! In the Hack Shack, you’ll interact with experts to learn and try out new solutions for building, designing, and using software. If you’ve ever been to the HPE DEV Hack Shack at HPE Discover, you’ll know how valuable and fun it can be. In addition to the Jupyter Notebooks-based workshops, we’ll be offering competitive coding challenges and fun games to play.

## What you’ll find in the Hack Shack

In the HPE DEV Hack Shack you’ll find experts giving talks on a wide variety of topics, from AI and machine learning to containers and DevOps. Workshops are open to all levels with some aimed specifically at beginners, like API 101 or Introduction to the HPE Container Platform.
