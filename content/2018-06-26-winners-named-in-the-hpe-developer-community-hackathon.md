On May 24, HPE developers from around the world and across various HPE organizations began participating in the HPE Hackathon. A total of 49 individual hackers took up the challenge, comprising 18 teams that ranged in size from 1-7 participants. In the end, 12 teams crossed the finish line and presented outstanding projects to a distinguished panel of 4 judges.![may24 2](https://hpe-developer-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/2018/6/may24-2-1530031551619.jpg)
Judging took place from June 4th-10th. Teams were given 15 minutes to present their projects, which were judged on the following criteria:
- 20%: Completeness & Presentation
- 20%: Technical Merit
- 20%: Originality
- 40%: Potential Customer Impact 

Participant experience varied widely--from teams with little to no coding background (looking to grow their skills), all the way to very experienced coders. Each team was assigned a coach from the Developer Experience & Incubation team to guide and assist the team’s work.

# And the winners are… 

Congratulations to **Team Chatbot**, who was awarded first place for their project. Team members include Jesse Olsen, Dana Lynn, and Jeroen Kleen.

**Team Reality Distortion** received second place honors. Congratulations to the one-man team of Damian Janiszewski.

Damian developed an HPE OneSphere extension module that exports HPE OneSphere metrics for Prometheus time series database and alerting system. Prometheus metrics are then easily visualized using Grafana dashboards.

Hackathons are a great way for companies to foster innovation through collaboration and creative problem-solving. And that’s exactly what the HPE Developer Community witnessed. The hackathon was designed to: 

1.	Foster cross-organization collaboration and innovation 
2.	Provide an opportunity for personal growth (growing software development skills in HPE)
3.	Provide an opportunity for the community to create tangible customer-centric solutions
4.	Build a foundation upon which to create a robust internal HPE developer community
5.	Have fun!
