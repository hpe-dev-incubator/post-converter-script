As promised in my last [Meet the HPE DEV Team](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/meet-the-hpe-dev-team) blog, I’m going to introduce you to additional members of the [HPE Dev Community.](https://developer.hpe.com/community) This time I’d like to focus on some of our [Azure Stack](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/cloud/azure-hybrid-cloud.html) experts, Jeff Krenek and Vivek Kulkarni, who work on accelerating the customer adoption of hybrid IT environments. As part of the Azure Stack Innovation Centers, they bring in customer and partner developers to experiment and try out Microsoft Azure Stack, which often results in these developers becoming better informed on the potential of using this platform. 

Jeff manages the code incubation team for HPE DEV as well as the Azure Stack Innovation Centers. He knows hybrid IT and [hyperconverged solutions](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/hyper-converged.html) well, having previously acted as the lead product architect for HPE’s hyperconverged products. We rely on Jeff’s many years of experience. Not only can he pull the right people together to attend to a specific issue, as he does with our strike teams, he also knows a lot about what’s gone on before. He knows what’s worked, what hasn’t, and how to best apply previously obtained insights to new situations. Jeff was a born manager. It’s easy to see how he likes to support people and help them grow. The fact that he’s on the advisory board for the Computer Engineering Department for his alma mater attests to this, as does the fact that interns seem to do very well in this group. As the father of four kids in college, I suspect he’s had a lot of practice!

Vivek is a Certified Specialist for Azure Solutions. He helps build the solutions for users and operators to run scripts and use cases for Azure Stack, as well as solutions to assist in Azure Stack migration. Although Vivek has only been with the team for a couple of years, he has a great deal of experience with Microsoft Azure, having worked at Microsoft for some time. Not only does Vivek assist our Azure Stack customers, but he also lends his Azure expertise to other groups inside HPE, including the [HPE GreenLake](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/services/it-consumption.html) team, to help them develop products and services around Azure. A graduate of B.V. Bhoomareddi College of Engineering and Technology, it’s great to have Vivek on our team.

As I pointed out in my last post, given that HPE is a leader in the technology industry, it has the advantage of being able to recruit some pretty impressive personalities. And they’re all very approachable. You can reach Jeff on Twitter [@KrenekJeff](https://twitter.com/KrenekJeff) and Vivek [@vkhpedev.](https://twitter.com/@vkhpedev) You can also connect with them on [Slack.](https://slack.hpedev.io/) 

But, enough from me. Why don’t you [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbglDBHnLh0&feature=youtu.be) and let them tell you their own stories.
